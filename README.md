# MultiLevelFeedbackQueue
This project implements a Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling algorithm, a dynamic priority scheduling technique used in operating systems. The MLFQ algorithm organizes processes into multiple queues with different priority levels, adjusting priorities based on the process behavior.

# Features:
Three Priority Queues: Implements three priority queues with varying levels of CPU attention (50%, 30%, 20%).
Dynamic Priority Adjustment: Priorities are adjusted dynamically based on the burst time and response time of processes.
Process Scheduler: Simulates the execution of processes through the MLFQ algorithm, demonstrating how CPU attention is distributed among the queues.
Visualization: Provides a visual representation of the state of each queue during the simulation.
