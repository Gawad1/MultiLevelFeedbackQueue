# MultiLevelFeedbackQueue
This project implements a Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling algorithm, a dynamic priority scheduling technique used in operating systems. The MLFQ algorithm organizes processes into multiple queues with different priority levels, adjusting priorities based on the process behavior.
